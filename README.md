<h2>Objective:</h2>
Each time a user clicks on an image, the user score is tracked, and the current high score is updated. The user score will reset to 0 if the user clicks on the same image twice! Everytime an image is clicked, the images rendered to the screen will shuffle. The objective is to get to 12 points. Have fun!
